In the same way, the User who has made a counter offer will be obliged to comply when it has been expressly accepted by the Seller under the mechanism established by the Site for that purpose. Despite the fact that the Site cannot oblige the Buyer User to complete the purchase and sale, the Seller User may initiate against the Buyer User, all the legal actions it deems pertinent to obtain the fulfillment of its obligation."
